                    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
                         Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. <br /> <br />
                         This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end,
                         and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
